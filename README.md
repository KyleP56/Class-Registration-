# Class-Registration-
This is a code that allows students to enroll for their college classes.
You have a main class called "Courses" that defines variables and methods that will be used by two sub other classes
those two sub classes are named "Traditional" and "Online"
Within "Traditional" and "Online" I define the variables needed from the parent class and I defined the new variables need from the specific classes
I also overide methods within the two sub classes
The main code reads in a file and adds them to a array that defines them as a "traditional" course or a "online" course.
Once I completely read in the file, I output a menu for the user to use.
This menu allows the user to search for a course based off the course number
This mean also allows the user to add a course to their trail schedule.
This mean also allows them to output their trail schedule to see what their classes are
